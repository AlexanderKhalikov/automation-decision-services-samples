# Automation Decision Services samples

These samples give you a working introduction to Automation Decision Services.

There are three main directories:

  - **Archives**: Contains sample decision services that you can run directly in an Automation Decision Services runtime.
  - **Projects**: Contains sample decision projects in compressed files that you can import directly into Decision Designer, the development environment in Automation Decision Services.
  - **Samples**: Contains sample code that you can use in Automation Decision Services.

It is recommended that you do the tutorial [Getting started in Automation Decision Services](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYHZ8_20.0.x/com.ibm.dba.aid/gs_ddesigner_topics/dba_ddesigner_intro.html) before using these samples.
